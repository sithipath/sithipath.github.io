<h1 id="the-classic-gamblers-ruin-problem">The classic Gambler’s Ruin
problem</h1>
<p>A gambler begins with an initial amount of <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> dollars. In each round, the gambler
either wins $1 with a probability of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> or loses $1 with a probability of <span
class="math inline">\(q = 1 - p\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq p \leq 1\)</span>. The gambler continues
playing until they either reach <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
dollars or lose all their money. The key question is: what is the
probability that the gambler will eventually reach <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> dollars?</p>
<h2 id="if-we-are-playing-a-fair-game-p-0.5">If we are playing a fair
game (<span class="math inline">\(p =0.5\)</span>)</h2>
<p>If we define <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> to be the
random variable of the amount of dollars the gambler possesses after
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> rounds of games, assuming the
gambling is ongoing. And  T  is the number of times that the gambler
stops. Then <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> is a martingale
because by conditional probability. Then we can derive 4 equations
here.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E[X(t+1)] = \frac{1}{2}(E[X(t)] - 1) +
\frac{1}{2}(E[X(t)] + 1).
\label{eq:expected_value}\]</span> <em>Note: intuitively</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E[X(T)] = X(0) = i.
\label{eq:martingale_property}\]</span> <em>Note: Martingale
property.</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E[X(T)] = i = P(N) \times N + P(0)
\times 0.
\label{eq:probability}\]</span> <em>Note: <span
class="math inline">\(P(N)\)</span> is the probability that the gambler
ends up with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> dollars.</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(N) = \frac{i}{N}.
\label{eq:solve}\]</span> <em>Note: Solve from (3)</em><br />
The equations are pretty intuitive: in a fair game, the probability of
doubling your money is 0.5, just as the chance of going bankrupt.
Nothing surprising here.</p>
<h2 id="if-we-are-not-playing-a-fair-game">If we are not playing a fair
game</h2>
<p>If you start with $10 and play a fair game where you either lose $1
or win $1 with a probability of 0.5, the chances of doubling your money
to $20 or going bankrupt are equal at 0.5. But what if the probability
of winning is 0.6? Intuitively, you might think the probability of
doubling your money is 0.6. However, the actual probability is much
higher. I’ll run the Python code below to demonstrate this using Monte
Carlo simulation.</p>
<pre><code>import random

def simulate_game(start_amount, target_amount, win_prob, num_simulations):
    success_count = 0
    
    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        current_amount = start_amount
        
        while current_amount &gt; 0 and current_amount &lt; target_amount:
            if random.random() &lt; win_prob:
                current_amount += 1
            else:
                current_amount -= 1
        
        if current_amount &gt;= target_amount:
            success_count += 1
    
    return success_count / num_simulations

# Parameters
start_amount = 10
target_amount = 20
num_simulations = 100000

# Simulate for game with win probability of 0.6
win_prob_higher = 0.6
probability_higher = simulate_game(start_amount, target_amount, win_prob_higher, num_simulations)</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that the probability of doubling your money is actually
0.98.</p>
<h2 id="monte-carlo-simulation">Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
<p>I created a graph that shows the relationship between the probability
of winning and the probability of success. The graph illustrates that
when your winning probability increases to 0.55, the probability of
successfully doubling your money increases significantly. In fact, even
a slight increase in the winning probability to 0.51 raises the chance
of success to 0.6.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="p1.PNG" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Next, I generated a graph depicting the expected number of games a
gambler needs to play to either double their money or go broke. I found
that if the probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is 0.5,
the expected number of games played is 100. However, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> increases to 0.6, this number drops to
48. The takeaway is that even a slight increase in the winning
probability above 0.5 can significantly reduce the expected number of
games needed.</p>

<h1 id="jim-simons-what-about-him">Jim Simons, what about him?</h1>
<p>Jim Simons, famously known as “The Man Who Solved the Market,”
managed to achieve an impressive average annual return of 66%.
Surprisingly, his win rate on trades is said to be just 51%, which many
find hard to believe. But, as shown earlier, with a 51% win rate in a
gambling scenario, there’s a 60% chance of doubling an initial $10
million to $20 million within 100 trades.</p>
<p>Sadly, the exact secrets behind Simons’ success remain unknown due to
1) his secretive nature and 2) He died RIP. However, considering some
Twitter claims that the Medallion Fund makes over 150,000 trades per day
(though this number is a bit hard to swallow), it starts to make sense.
The guy just revolutionized the industry of discretion and due diligence
into the industry of gambling operations.</p>
<h1 id="a-life-lesson">a life lesson</h1>
<p>By knowing that just having a 1% better chance of winning than losing
can make a big difference. This isn’t just about trading or
gambling—it’s about life. The idea of the Gambler’s Ruin problem gets me
motivated to get up, create, trade, and take risks. If we make sure we
have a tiny edge and keep trying, we can end up in a much better place.
After 100 tries, we might be twice as well off as when we started and
it’s mathematically proven.</p>
