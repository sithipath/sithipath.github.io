<h1 class="title">How Do We Calculate the Livability of Manhattan’s
Neighborhoods?</h1>
</header>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>People seeking to find the ideal place to live in Manhattan often
face challenges in obtaining helpful information. Existing resources
like the AARP<span class="math inline"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Livability
Index offer some guidance, but they may not be tailored to a specific
demographic. This project aims to address this by identifying and
measuring the livability of Manhattan neighborhoods for different age
groups. We will investigate factors like transportation access, housing
affordability, and restaurant density to understand how they affect a
neighborhood’s overall livability. The project’s value lies in assisting
individuals to improve their quality of life and aiding governments in
making informed decisions about resource allocation and policy
design.</p>
<p>To achieve our goal, we utilized various datasets, as mentioned in
the following section, to extract information about businesses,
services, restaurants, grocery shops, apartment rents, and sentiments of
population based on location. We utilized publicly available data and
fetched information of businesses, other services, and trends in each
neighborhood using public third-party APIs.</p>
<h1 id="datasets">Datasets</h1>
<p>We are using data from many sources in order to determine different
elements of the livability score for each neighborhood, as shown
below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We are using Yelp’s Fusion Open API to get restaurants and
business data from Yelp across more than 100 categories. We are curating
our dataset from the response data of Fusion API for about 1100+
businesses (restaurants, services) across Manhattan. Total size of
business and categories datasets is 100 MB.</p></li>
<li><p>We are using a 26 KB dataset from NYC Open Data that contains
latitude and longitude values for the center of each neighborhood in
Manhattan in order to classify each data point from our other datasets
into a neighborhood.</p></li>
<li><p>We are using a dataset from Streeteasy that contains the median
rental prices in each neighborhood for different sizes of apartments
(studio up to three bedroom apartments). This dataset is 1.3 MB in size
and its features include monthly median rental prices for each month in
each neighborhood for the past  10 years.</p></li>
<li><p>We are also using a 468 KB dataset that contains the latitude and
longitude coordinates of subway stations in Manhattan.</p></li>
<li><p>We are using Twitter<span
class="math inline"><sup>[3]</sup></span> data, where we extracted the
tweet content posted between 14th April and 28th April for each
neighborhood. After thorough filtering and cleaning, the expected data
size is around 80 MB.</p></li>
<li><p>Doordash Restaurants and Recognized Grocery Stores datasets were
also used for further analysis. The Doordash Restaurant dataset obtained
from Kaggle is 4.8 MB, while the Recognized Grocery Stores dataset
obtained from NYC OpenData is 49 KB.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
<p>We curated most of our datasets either from other available datasets
or from public APIs from Yelp and Twitter by extracting the most
relevant information affecting the livability of a neighbourhood. We
found that most of the data based on location includes latitude and
longitude information and felt the need to curate a common mapping logic
to map each data to a neighbourhood. We identified the centroid lat,long
for each neighbourhood and created neighbourhood name column for each
dataset using this mapping logic, to join our results based on
neighbourhood names.</p>
<p>Some of the data cleaning steps we have taken include removing all
the rows of data from boroughs outside of Manhattan and backward filling
missing values (in the case of the Streeteasy dataset). For twitter, we
need to process data by conducting language filtering, removing
@mentions, discarding tweets containing only URLs, excluding tweets not
relevant to the neighborhood, and determining the location of each
tweet. For Yelp dataset, we removed invalid data rows, and included only
the most important data based on review counts and average ratings to
disregard outliers. For Doordash Restaurants and Grocery Stores
datasets, we defined a new dataframe with only the relevant data,
including the restaurant/grocery store information and geographic
location.</p>
<p>One issue we faced is defining the boundaries of each neighborhood.
We found datasets that contain many latitude and longitude coordinates
outlining each neighborhood’s boundary, but we decided that using such
dataset would pose more challenges to calculating the neighborhood of a
single coordinate point as opposed to comparing that coordinate to the
closest neighborhood centroid.</p>
<p>On Twitter data, our analysis involves the utilization of NLP via
TextBlob’s<span class="math inline"><sup>4</sup></span> Naive Bayes
classifier to perform sentiment analysis. Through this classification,
we are able to measure both the polarity and subjectivity of the content
within each tweet.</p>
<p>We used data from MTA to calculate the number of subway station
entrances in each neighborhood. Since each subway station entrance was
not assigned to a neighborhood in the MTA dataset, we determined each
data point’s neighborhood using our custom function that calculates the
distance between the latitude and longitude values of the data point
with that of the neighborhood centroids to find the most likely
neighborhood for each data point.</p>
<p>In order to assign weights to each dataset according to the age, we
rely on research<span class="math inline"><sup>[6]</sup></span> to
determine the significance of each factor for different age groups.
These findings are then applied to calculate the ultimate scores for
each neighborhood as shown below.<br />
for a user age <span class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>, we derive
weight of each category: <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em><sub><em>q</em></sub></span>: Weight of
neighborhood quality</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>w</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span>:
Weight of convenience to public transport</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>w</em><sub><em>a</em></sub></span>:
Weight of affordability from the prior study</p>
<p>For a neighborhood <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>, we
can then derive the following scores:</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em></sub></span>:
Score associated with Twitter activity</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><sub><em>d</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>h</em></sub></span>:
Score associated with DoorDash activity</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><sub><em>g</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>y</em></sub></span>:
Score associated with grocery availability</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><sub><em>m</em><em>t</em><em>a</em></sub></span>:
Score associated with MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority)
convenience</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><sub><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>y</em></sub></span>:
Score associated with StreetEasy (real estate marketplace)
activity<br />
The final score can be calculated using the following formula:<br />
</p>
<figure>
<img src="picpuic.png" />
</figure>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>One aspect of the results includes the number of positive/negative
sentiment tweets and the average sentiment score for each neighborhood.
The sentiment score scale ranges from -1 to 1, with a score of 1
denoting a highly positive sentiment and a score of -1 indicating a
neutral sentiment. Our underlying hypothesis is that if someone is in a
neighborhood, for example, “Roosevelt Island”, and tweets something
positive that has the word “Roosevelt Island”, then it implies higher
livability for “Roosevelt Island”. The capture below shows the sentiment
score of each neighborhood and the proportion of positive tweets of the
top 10 neighborhoods that have the highest number of tweets.</p>
<figure>
<img src="init_twitter.JPG" />
</figure>
<p>We also used the Streeteasy dataset to determine a “trendiness”,
where we used to calculate the recent levels of demand for
neighborhoods. Below, we plot the neighborhoods we consider to be the
most “trendy”, where prices have risen the most in the past few years.
Chelsea, Flatiron, and West Village appear to be the most trendy
neighborhoods, which confirms our prior suspicions. We believe that if
prices are rapidly increasing for a neighborhood, it serves as an
indication of higher livability since there is higher demand in that
neighborhood than elsewhere.</p>
<figure>
<img src="init_median.JPG" />
</figure>
<p>Another factor of livability regarding apartment prices is
affordability. We took the median price for all apartment types (studio,
one bedroom, two bedroom, three+ bedroom, and coop) for each
neighborhood and calculated the average price over the last thirteen
years. From those values, we normalized them from a score of 0 to 100.
Once we had those scores, where a higher score indicated a higher rent
price, we subtracted 100 from each of those values to invert the scores.
So now, the neighborhoods with lower rent prices (more affordable) have
a higher score than neighborhoods with higher rent prices. We then used
these "affordability" scores to calculate the final "livability" score
in the end.</p>
<figure>
<img src="streeteasy.JPG" />
</figure>
<p>From Yelp, Doordash and Grocery Stores datasets, we computed the
total number of restaurants, grocery stores and businesses within each
neighborhood along with their types and user ratings. The results helped
us determine the quality of life provided by the neighborhood based on
the available options of delivery, shopping, services and grocery stores
and in terms of proximity for its residents. As shown below, for the
Doordash Restaurants as well as the Grocery Stores datasets, we
calculated the total number of restaurants and grocery stores in the
neighborhoods presented in the datasets. From the count of restaurants
and grocery stores, we normalized the values from a score of 0 to 1; a
neighborhood with a normalized score of 1 indicated that it has the most
number of services, and so provides the best quality of life for its
residents.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Normalized.png" />
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="from_yelp.png" />
</figure>
<p>Another important consideration of livability is convenience. We
define convenience of a neighborhood as having a high number of subway
stations. We analyzed a dataset containing all the MTA subway stations
in New York City and calculated how many subway entrances are in each
neighborhood. We then normalized the number of subway entrances between
0 and 100 to be used in our final calculation of livability, with a
higher score indicating more subway entrances and thus higher
convenience for a neighborhood.</p>
<figure>
<img src="mta.JPG" />
</figure>
<p>Here are the final results and the scores broken down for each
category.</p>
<p>We used weights for three different categories to determine the final
output for each neighborhood: quality of neighborhood (as given by
Twitter sentiment data, DoorDash data, and grocery store data),
affordability (as given by Streeteasy rental price data), and
convenience (as given by the MTA subway station data). We determined the
weights based on research<span class="math inline"><sup>[5]</sup></span>
that reflected the importance of each one of these categories to
different age groups of residents. We used those weights to calculate
the final livability scores for each neighborhood in our study.</p>
<figure>
<img src="final_results_broken_down.JPG" />
</figure>
<p>Below are the final rankings for each neighborhood by age groups.
Midtown, Financial District, and Inwood placed in the top 3 for most age
demographics. We found that these three neighborhoods are most popular
for the younger age groups. We believe this is due to the fact that
younger people optimize for convenience to public transportation and
access to restaurants and grocery stores when choosing a neighborhood.
On the other hand, we noticed that older age groups prefer neighborhoods
that are quieter and more affordable since many older folks are living
on their retirement savings.</p>
<figure>
<img src="final_results.png" />
</figure>
<p>Finally, we develop a map that illustrates the livability of each
neighborhood. In addition, we design a recommendation system that allows
users to input their age as shown in our video presentation. The system
then generates personalized results, such as the example provided below,
which displays the livability scores for different age groups.
Specifically, it presents the livability score for a 25-year-old
individual and a 30-year-old individual.</p>
<figure>
<img src="map_score_reccom.png" />
</figure>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, there are many factors that contribute to a
neighborhood’s overall livability. Overall sentiment and vibe of a
neighborhood is a strong predictor of a neighborhood’s livability and we
were able to assess the sentiment of a neighborhood using Twitter data.
Affordability is another important factor of livability, and using
rental data from Streeteasy, we identified the most and least affordable
neighborhoods. Easy access to restaurants and grocery stores plays
another important role in a neighborhood; people like to have many
options, and we noticed this preference is very strong amongst younger
people. More livable neighborhoods also have greater access to public
transportation. We calculated a neighborhood’s convenience to public
transportation using MTA’s subway data and noticed a strong correlation
between a high convenience score and the highest ranked neighborhoods.
We learned that there are many factors that can affect a neighborhood’s
livability and different age groups weigh these factors differently when
choosing a neighborhood to live in.</p>
