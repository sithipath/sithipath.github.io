## Public Policy Research

We (Ayush, Hatsuo, Matt, Zain, and I) extract and analyze data from Twitter, Doordash, MTA, Yelp, and Streeteasy to determine the best neighborhood to live in Manhattan!


### [Leveraging Markov Chains for Citi Bike Allocation in NYC](assets/project/MUU-Project_Final.html)
Christina, Zain, and I are delving into the stochastic realm of Markov Chains to enhance the optimization of Citi Bike distribution across New York City

## Financial Markets Explorations

### [Comparing the Performance of Different Forecasting Models to Predict Major Currency Exchange Rates](assets/project/FX_to_html.html)
We posit that the foreign exchange (FX) market, particularly major currency pairs, operates with a high degree of efficiency. Consequently, historical price data alone is unlikely to possess predictive power. We disagree.

### [FX analysis using COT report, retail sentiment and a bit of fundamentals](assets/project/Fundamental_analysis/fundamental.html)
Unlocking insights from public data sources for retail traders who can’t afford a Bloomberg Terminal.

## Others writings
### [The Gambler’s Ruin Problem, Monte Carlo, Jim Simons and a life lesson](assets/project/gambler_ruin/gambler_ruin_p.html)
The Gambler’s Ruin problem popped up in a letter from Blaise Pascal to Pierre Fermat way back in 1656. Jim Simons passed away in May 2024. Both make me ponder life a bit.
