### [How Do We Calculate the Livability of Manhattanâ€™s Neighborhoods?](assets/project/DSIW/livelability.html)
We (Ayush, Hatsuo, Matt, Zain, and I) extract and analyze data from Twitter, Doordash, MTA, Yelp, and Streeteasy to determine the best neighborhood to live in Manhattan!


### [Leveraging Markov Chains for Citi Bike Allocation in NYC](assets/project/MUU-Project_Final.html)
Christina, Zain, and I are delving into the stochastic realm of Markov Chains to enhance the optimization of Citi Bike distribution across New York City


### [Comparing the Performance of Different Forecasting](assets/project/FX_to_html.html)
We posit that the foreign exchange (FX) market, particularly major currency pairs, operates with a high degree of efficiency. Consequently, historical price data alone is unlikely to possess predictive power. We aim to test this hypothesis.
